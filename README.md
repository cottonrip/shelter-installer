# --------------


# shelter-installer
uwu/shelter installer for linux

## usage:
1) install
    - choose this for first time install

2) apply / update
    - choose this after client update

3) uninstall
    - self-explanatory lol

you need to run the script as root because normal user doesn't have access to discords folder.

⚠️ i am NOT RESPONSIBLE for any harm caused to your system or for getting you banned from discord (client modifications are against discords ToS) ⚠️
